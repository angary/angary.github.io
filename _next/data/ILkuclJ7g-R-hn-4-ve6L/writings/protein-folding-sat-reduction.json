into a specific, complex 3D structure.</p>\n<p>A prime example of this is myoglobin, an oxygen-binding protein found in muscle tissue.\nThe specific way myoglobin folds creates a small, hydrophobic pocket that is perfectly shaped to hold a heme group, which contains the iron atom that actually binds to oxygen [2].\nIf the protein were to misfold, this pocket would not form correctly, and the myoglobin would be unable to perform its crucial function of storing oxygen.</p>\n<p>Given that these chains can be very long, the number of possible folding configurations can be astronomical (up to $10^{300}$), making it computationally challenging to predict the final structure from the amino acid sequence alone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-computational-challenge\">A Computational Challenge</h2>\n<p>The many possible ways a sequence can fold makes it an interesting computational problem, where our goal is to try and determine what structure a sequence will fold into as fast as possible.</p>\n<h1 id=\"protein-folding-via-the-hp-model\"><a href=\"#protein-folding-via-the-hp-model\">Protein Folding via the HP model</a></h1>\n\n<p>The Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model is a way of encoding an amino sequence into a boolean sequence.</p>\n<p>It works by classifying the 20 standard amino acids into either <strong>hydrophobic (H)</strong> (avoids water) or <strong>hydrophilic (P)</strong> (attracted to water).\nHence by assigning <strong>H</strong> to <code>1</code> or <code>true</code>, and <strong>P</strong> to <code>0</code> or <code>false</code> we can convert the amino sequence to a boolean sequence $S$, where $S_i$ represents if there is a H or a P at position $i$ in the sequence, with 1 encoding a H and 0 encoding a P.</p>\n<p>The maximum configuration is then an embedding which maximises the number of adjacent 1&#39;s on the grid $G$.</p>\n<p>To find the optimal structure we conduct a linear search, starting at the previous instance in which it was satisfiable, and then increasing the goal contacts by 1 each time, and solving, until it is unsatisfiable.\nThe maximum contacts is then the one which produced the largest satisfiable instance.\nDespite being a linear search, this approach worked quite well since satisfiable instances could be solved much faster than unsatisfiable instances</p>\n<h2 id=\"legal-embedding\">Legal Embedding</h2>\n<p>A legal embedding must follow the following rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each character in the sequence gets assigned to some point on the grid.</li>\n<li>No character in the sequence gets assigned to more than one point on the grid.</li>\n<li>Each point of the grid gets assigned at most one character in the sequence.</li>\n<li>Two adjacent characters in the sequence must be placed on two points that are neighbours on the grid in either the horizontal or vertical direction, but not both.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The points of the grid are enumerated from 1 to $w$ for the 2D version of the problem, where $G = \\{ j \\mid 1 \\leq j \\leq w^2\\}$ and from 1 to $w^3$ for the 3D version, where $G = \\{ j \\mid 1 \\leq j \\leq w^3\\}$.</p>\n<p>For the 2D version, $w$ can be calculated as:</p>\n<p>$$\nw =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 + \\lfloor \\frac{n}{4} \\rfloor &amp;
