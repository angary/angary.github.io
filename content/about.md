Hi, I'm Gary Sun and I'm studying Computer Science at the University of New South Wales. 

I like algorithms, backend development, and some theoretical computer science. Some languages I like to program in are Haskell, Python, and Java.

In my spare time, I like hikes, Dota 2 (more specifically Lone Druid), dogs, frogs, and pogs.

```
-- Some Haskell code to prove I'm cool and quirky

data Person = Person {firstName :: String, lastName :: String}

main :: IO ()
main = let g = Person "gary" "sun" in putStrLn $ "an" ++ firstName g
```
