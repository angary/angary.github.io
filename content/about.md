Hi, I'm Gary Sun and I'm studying Computer Science at the University of New South Wales.

I like algorithms, backend development, and some theoretical computer science.
Some languages I like to program in are TypeScript, Python, Rust, Haskell, and Java.

```hs
-- Some Haskell code to prove I'm cool and quirky

data Person = Person {firstName :: String, lastName :: String}

main :: IO ()
main = let g = Person "gary" "sun" in putStrLn $ "an" ++ firstName g
```
